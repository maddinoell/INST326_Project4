    "I improved my notes program by making the visual display more appealing and updating the functionality of the program by changing the color, adding a scroll bar, enlarging the main window, and adjusting the main window buttons' size and alignment. \n",
    "I made the color more appealing and user friendly by making it more vibrant instead of white, I changed it to my favorite color pink to make it more colorful and fun. I got rid of self. geometry so that the program can be full-screen with the full-screen button on the top right and when it runs the buttons will be aligned properly with the size of the window. I added a scroll bar on the right side of the note text box so that we users can write longer notes and be able to see them by scrolling up and down. I adjusted to main window buttons to be bigger and centered to match the new sizing of the main window I did in self. geometry. \n",
    "These improvements I made make my program better because by making the program more colorful, symmetric, and bigger the user interface becomes more engaging for users to use it for a longer time. Adding a scroll bar improves being able to use and write longer notes, improving its usability for users. These improvements make my program easier to use for anyone to use and making visually appealing improvements can impact and/or change user perception using the program, if it has less color and useability options it will become less suitable for users to use comfortably. \n",
    "These improvements relate to the principles of OOP like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism because these changes were made by inheriting the code from the original display layout for the main window, buttons, etc from the base classes such as noteform and mainwindow and added the specific attributes in subclasses for what I wanted. The program adapts its looks and usability based on user preferences and these changes separate elements of the program such as color, window layout, and size from the program's purpose\n",

The user can search the title of their old notes in the search bar and the results will appear in the results box next to the note text box by clicking the search button. The title and text contents of the note will be displayed in the box after searching. If a user is creating multiple notes, this function is useful for finding these notes within the program to improve user usability and experience. \n",
    "This function makes my program better because it allows people to efficiently locate and open notes they want within a large program. Instead of manually looking through the notes, they can now manage them with the search function. This improves user usability, productivity, and the organzaition of the program.\n",
    "These improvements relate to the principles of OOP like abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism because in order to create the search function I used code from the other functions classes and reused the code from the noteform class to create and implement the search function. It lets users to interact with a simplified interface to search for notes so it is not complex. So, this code can be reused. The search functions lets users to search notes using a specific title, which can be extended in the future with different filter techniques such as searching by tags or links. "
